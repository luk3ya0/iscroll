Gone are the days when images jumps in and out of the window when scrolling! This package provides smooth scrolling over images.

Due to some technical problems, the code is not merging into Emacs in the near futher. When it finally does merge, this package can retire.

To use this package:

#+begin_src
M-x iscroll-mode RET
#+end_src

This mode remaps mouse scrolling functions and ~next/previous-line~. If you use other commands, you need to adapt them accordingly. See ~iscroll-mode-map~ and ~iscroll-mode~ for some inspiration.

~iscroll-mode~ is kind of slow in programming modes, but fast in text modes. So I suggest to only enable it in text modes.

* Commands

- iscroll-up
- iscroll-down
- iscroll-next-line
- iscroll-previous-line

* Evil mode

Iscroll.el doesnâ€™t work with Evil out-of-the-box. You need to add some boilerplate.

you can use the ~iscroll-mode~ like following:

#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'evil
  ;; ...
  (defun scroll-up-org-mode()
    (interactive)
    (if (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
        (iscroll-up)
      (evil-next-visual-line)))

  (defun scroll-down-org-mode()
    (interactive)
    (if (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
        (iscroll-down)
      (evil-previous-visual-line)))
	;; ...
  (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-n") 'scroll-up-org-mode)
  (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-p") 'scroll-down-org-mode)

  ;; ...
)
#+end_src

Upon the cursor arrives at the images, use c+n or c+p to scroll smoothly.
